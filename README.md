# U2Fusion
Code of U2Fusion: a unified unsupervised image fusion network for multiple image fusion tasks, including multi-modal (VIS-IR, medical), multi-exposure and multi-focus image fusion.

## Tips:<br>
Large files should be downloaded separately, including the following files: <br>
#### For training:<br>
* [Training dataset](https://pan.baidu.com/s/18hQyGNlhVb3oXAXOJ5LZCQ)<br>
The code to create your own training dataset can be found [*here*](https://github.com/hanna-xu/utils).
* [vgg16](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1vK3l8rzgAkxcKpLvnFAwXA) (put it in 'VGGnet/')<br>

#### Dealing with RGB input:<br>
* Refer to [this code](https://github.com/hanna-xu/utils/tree/master/fusedY2RGB).<br>
